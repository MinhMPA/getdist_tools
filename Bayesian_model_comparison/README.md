# Estimating Bayesian significance and tension metrics with `SignificanceBarometer`

This module provide methods to estimate difference Bayesian significance/tension metrics.
Main class and methods are defined in `class SignificanceBarometer` at `significance_barometer.py`
Example usages can be found in the companion Jupyter [notebook](./SignificanceBarometer_example.ipynb)

The module was used in ["Sweeping Horndeski canvas: new growth-rate parameterization for modified-gravity theories"](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2023/09/028) and the upcoming "Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 Results" papers. Example data in `example_data/` also come from the same paper(s). If the module is useful for your works, please consider to cite those.
